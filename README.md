This tutorial is two parts. Part 1 teaches how to create a Blazor Server web app in a Development environment using Visual Studio 2022
and a local SQL Server (SQLEXPRESS).  Part 2 teaches how to port this Blazor app to Microsoft Azure (which is the PROD environment).  
Azure web app configuration settings for connection strings are used to override the connection string in appsettings.json which is used in the DEV environment.
